# 294. Flip Game II

Difficulty: 3.0

Some LeetCode Game theory:
Concept 1 **Impartial Game**:
Given a particular arrangement of the game board, if either player have exactly the same set of moves should he move first, and both players have exactly the same winning condition, then this game is called **impartial game**. For example, chess is not impartial because the players can control only their own pieces, and the +- flip game, on the other, is impartial.

Concept 2 **Normal Player vs Misere Play**:
If the winning condition of the game is that the **oppoinent has no valid moves**, then this is said to follow the **normal play convention**; if the winning condition is that the **player himself has no valid moves**, the the game is a **Misere** game. Our += flip has apprently normal play.
