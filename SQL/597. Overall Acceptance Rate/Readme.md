# 597. Friend Requests I: Overall Acceptance Rate

Difficulty: 2

In the requirement, we will need to count the distinct pair. using count (distinct) will be neccessary

Remember in MySQL, 1/0=null

Things I learned:
1. Using **round** function in SQL
2. 1/0 in MySQL will be treated as NULL
3. Count distincted pair: **count (distinct field1, field2)**
