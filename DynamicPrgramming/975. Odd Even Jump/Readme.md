# 975. Odd Even Jump

Difficulty: 4.0

After we **clearly** understand the question, we found that, for every jump, we basically **jump higher number or lower number alternatively**. So there are two states for each number, jump higher or jump lower.
Then the questions become quite straight-forward.
